### Tools

#### `RescaleText`

`RescaleText` tries fitting the text into it's container.

#### Properties

```bash
checkHeight = false
maxFontSize = 100
id = "no-id"
```

#### Usage with paperlesspaper

There is nothing you need to do. You can access each integration when creating a new image inside the app.

### Usage with custom ePaper displays

You need to convert the website into a picture.

Steps:

- Convert the website into a picture using [pupeteer](https://pptr.dev/)
- Additional compare image to avoid sending the same image twice
- Dither image
- Transmit dithered image

### Special DOM Elements for Puppeteer Rendering

To coordinate rendering and screenshot timing, the backend expects certain elements to be present in the DOM of the page being rendered. These elements are used to detect loading states and ensure screenshots are taken only after the page is fully ready.

### `#website-has-loading-element`

#### Purpose:

Indicates that the page has a custom loading state. If this element exists in the DOM, the backend will wait for the loading to finish before taking a screenshot.

#### Usage:

Add an element with the ID website-has-loading-element to your page while it is loading.

```html
<div id="website-has-loading-element" />
```

### `#website-has-loaded`

#### Purpose:

Signals that the page has finished loading and is ready for rendering. The backend waits for this element to appear before proceeding.

#### Usage:

Once your page is fully loaded and ready for a screenshot, add an element with the ID website-has-loaded to the DOM.

```html
<div id="website-has-loaded" />
```

### Fallback Behavior

If `#website-has-loading-element` is not found, the backend will wait for a fixed timeout (8.5 seconds) before taking a screenshot. This is a fallback to handle pages without explicit loading indicators.

## Loading helper (react.js)

A context provider that tracks the loading status of registered operations. Wrap your application (or a subtree) with this provider to enable loading state management.

**Props:**

- `children`: ReactNode — The content to render inside the provider.
- `finishedLoading` (optional): boolean — If set to `true`, marks all as loaded regardless of internal state.

**Behavior:**

- Renders a `<div id="website-has-loaded" />` when all registered operations are finished loading.
- Renders a `<div id="website-is-loading" />` when any operation is still loading.
- Always renders a `<div id="website-has-loading-element" />` for reference.

### `useLoading`

A custom hook to register and update the loading status of a component or operation.

**Arguments:**

- `id`: string — A unique identifier for the loading operation. If not provided, a random one is generated.

**Returns:**

- `setLoading`: (loading: boolean) => void — Call this function to update the loading status for the given id.

**Usage Example:**

```tsx
import { useLoading } from "../helpers/Loading";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const setLoading = useLoading({ id: "my-component" });

  useEffect(() => {
    setLoading(true);
    fetchData().finally(() => setLoading(false));
  }, []);

  // ...
};
```

## Internal Details

- The context tracks an array of `{ id, loading }` objects.
- `registerLoading(id)` adds a new loading operation if not already present.
- `setLoadingStatus(id, loading)` updates the loading state for a given id.
- `allFinishedLoading` is `true` if all registered operations are not loading, or if `finishedLoading` is set.

### Development
